This is because NaN represents an invalid number value, but it's still within the number type system. This is a common JavaScript quirk that catches many developers off guard.", difficulty: "intermediate", topic: "javascript", relatedConcepts: ["data types", "type coercion", "NaN"] },
      { question: "Which method adds elements to the end of an array?", options: ["push()", "pop()", "unshift()", "shift()"], correctAnswer: "push()", explanation: "The push() method adds one or more elements to the end of an array and returns the new length. pop() removes from the end, unshift() adds to the beginning, and shift() removes from the beginning.", difficulty: "beginner", topic: "javascript", relatedConcepts: ["arrays", "methods", "data manipulation"] },
      { question: "What does the '===' operator do in JavaScript?", options: ["Checks for equality", "Checks for equality without type coercion", "Assigns a value", "Checks if a variable is defined"], correctAnswer: "Checks for equality without type coercion", explanation: "The '===' operator performs strict equality comparison without type coercion. It checks both value and type, unlike '==' which performs type coercion. For example: '5' === 5 is false, but '5' == 5 is true.", difficulty: "intermediate", topic: "javascript", relatedConcepts: ["operators", "type coercion", "comparison"] },
      // Computer Science (Python)
      { question: "What is the correct way to create a function in Python?", options: ["function myFunc():", "def myFunc():", "create myFunc():", "func myFunc():"], correctAnswer: "def myFunc():", explanation: "In Python, functions are defined using the 'def' keyword followed by the function name and parentheses.

      // Computer Science (Java)
      { question: "Which keyword is used to define a constant in Java?", options: ["const", "final", "static", "var"], correctAnswer: "final", explanation: "In Java, the 'final' keyword is used to create constants. When applied to variables, it prevents reassignment. When combined with 'static', it creates class-level constants that are shared across all instances.", difficulty: "intermediate", topic: "java", relatedConcepts: ["keywords", "constants", "modifiers"] },
      // Computer Science (Algorithms)
      { question: "What is the time complexity of binary search?", options: ["O(n)", "O(log n)", "O(n¬≤)", "O(1)"], correctAnswer: "O(log n)", explanation: "Binary search has O(log n) time complexity because it eliminates half of the remaining elements in each step.

It has ultimate appellate jurisdiction over all federal and state court cases involving federal law, and original jurisdiction over a narrow range of cases including disputes between states.", difficulty: "beginner", topic: "constitutional-law", relatedConcepts: ["judicial system", "court hierarchy", "constitutional law"] },
      { question: "What does 'habeas corpus' mean?", options: ["You have the body", "Innocent until proven guilty", "Right to remain silent", "Due process of law"], correctAnswer: "You have the body", explanation: "Habeas corpus is a Latin term meaning 'you have the body.' It's a legal principle that protects against unlawful detention by requiring authorities to bring a prisoner before a court and justify their detention. It's a fundamental safeguard of individual liberty.", difficulty: "intermediate", topic: "constitutional-law", relatedConcepts: ["civil liberties", "detention", "legal principles"] },
      { question: "In contract law, what makes an agreement legally binding?", options: ["Verbal agreement", "Written document", "Consideration", "Signatures"], correctAnswer: "Consideration", explanation: "Consideration is the exchange of something of value between parties, making a contract legally binding. It can be money, goods, services, or a promise to do or not do something. Without consideration, an agreement is generally not enforceable as a contract.", difficulty: "intermediate", topic: "contracts", relatedConcepts: ["contract formation", "legal requirements", "enforceability"] },
      // Psychology
      { question: "Who is considered the father of psychoanalysis?", options: ["Carl Jung", "Sigmund Freud", "B.F.
